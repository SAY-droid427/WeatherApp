# WeatherApp

This web application has been developed using the openWeatherMap API. The user has to type in the name of the city whose weather he/she is interested in knowing and the weather conditions will be displayed. However if an invalid city name has been entered then an error message will be displayed and the user will be redirected to the main page again.
